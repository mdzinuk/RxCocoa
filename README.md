# Learning RxCocoa

RxCocoa provides everything we need, wraps most UIKit compononent under Observables by providing two extraordinary protocol capabilities are ControlEvent andControlproperties. The RxCocoa Observable has some specifications:
* The stream never fails.
* Complete sequence will call when control deallocates.
* Stream delivery events happen on main thread(MainScheduler).



## System requirements
For this tutorial we'll use Xcode 10.2.1, Swift 5.*,  [cocoapods 1.7.2](https://cocoapods.org) and [RxSwift 5.0 & RxCocoa 5.0](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift.git). Since, RxSwift, RxCocoa and RxRelay come on same package we don't need to worry about individual pods.

If you're new to Rx thing then please allow few times to visit my  [RxSwift tutorial](https://github.com/mdzinuk/RxSwift-Part-01) page first then come here again :).

## Getting Started with [RxCocoa-Tuts](https://github.com/mdzinuk/RxSwift-Part-01/tree/master/RxSwift-Tuts)
To get started, download [RxCocoa-Tuts] first(https://github.com/mdzinuk/RxSwift-Part-01/tree/master/RxSwift-Tuts)

Open the **RxCocoa-Tuts.xcworkspace**  project in Xcode to build, build the project by selecting **RxCocoa-Tuts** target if it is not selected.
